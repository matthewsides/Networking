## Networking Types and Standards

The below sections explain the benefits and constraints of different network types and standards. The purpose of any network is to share resources.

### Peer to Peer

A Peer to Peer network is in essence a conglomerate of computers that distribute and partition tasks or workloads between eachother,sharing resources. The network is termed "Peer to Peer" due to the lenient restraints and permissive nature, distributing or giving equal access to all systems connected to the network. 

The network is known for its simplicity with the ease of set up and flexability allowing user's to join and leave. Whilst the robust nature 

Advantage is its simplicity with the ease of set up (can join and leave) and cost 
robust in the sense because nobodys in charge , though consequently if someone drops out of the network when your downloading its lost.

### Client Server 


### Cloud Cluster

### Centralised

### Virtualised  


purpose, benefits, resource implications, communications, working practice, commercial opportunity, information sharing, collaboration


Purpose, benefits,resources required (servers software, cost, money, a lot or not much required), communications working practices, advantages from a working point of view, collaboration, etc.


benefits and constraints

talk about osi and tcp and the point of the conceptual models (gives us visualisation, can agree it and share the same information having a common understanding / a way of companys and manufacturers agreeing how it should be done creating standards ensuring they can communicate ways to agree how to solve problems ensuring things support the big picture)

2 conceptual models osi and tcp  (tcp model is a less layered version osi)

tcp protocol is not the same as the model

comparision between two 

tcp sits in the osi model 


conceptual models, osi models, tct model (using a table)

osi application layer talking about system /  networking applications (transferring information etc.)

IEEE (802.3, etc.) standards about physical cabling and transmission of data


protocols ipv4 (ipv6) ipv4 run out of ip addressess have tech to minimize the number of addressess used /  classic internet protocol
your address on the internet (private addressess not viable in the internet / public avaliable on the internet)


dns (domain name system) -  converts domain names to ip addressess and vice versa (ip addressess to domain names) ask parent dns if dont know (6-7 route dns systems in the world) information constantly updated
