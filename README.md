# Networking Types and Standards

Purpose, benefits,resources required (servers software, cost, money, a lot or not much required), communications working practices, advantages from a working point of view, collaboration, etc.


benefits and constraints

talk about osi and tcp and the point of the conceptual models (gives us visualisation, can agree it and share the same information having a common understanding / a way of companys and manufacturers agreeing how it should be done creating standards ensuring they can communicate ways to agree how to solve problems ensuring things support the big picture)

2 conceptual models osi and tcp  (tcp model is a less layered version osi)

tcp protocol is not the same as the model

comparision between two 

tcp sits in the osi model 


conceptual models, osi models, tct model (using a table)

osi application layer talking about system /  networking applications (transferring information etc.)

IEEE (802.3, etc.) standards about physical cabling and transmission of data


protocols ipv4 (ipv6) ipv4 run out of ip addressess have tech to minimize the number of addressess used /  classic internet protocol
your address on the internet (private addressess not viable in the internet / public avaliable on the internet)


dns (domain name system) -  converts domain names to ip addressess and vice versa (ip addressess to domain names) ask parent dns if dont know (6-7 route dns systems in the world) information constantly updated
