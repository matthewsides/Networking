## Networking Types and Standards

The below sections explain the benefits and constraints of different network types and standards. The purpose of any network is to share resources.

### Peer to Peer

A Peer to Peer network is in essence a conglomerate of computers that distribute and partition tasks or workloads between eachother,sharing resources. The network is termed "Peer to Peer" due to the lenient restraints and permissive nature, distributing or giving equal access to all systems connected to the network.  Peers are inprinciple coequal, or equipotent nodes in a non-hierarchical network.

The network is acknowledged for its simplicity with regards to the ease of set up and flexability, a benefit in using the network as the autonomous aspect grants user's the option to join or leave a network. Whilst the resources required to set up a Peer to Peer encompass; at least two computers, a network adapter for each computer or a cross over cable (cables), network configuration, protocol stack.

In addition the network is robust in the sense that noone is in charge, P2P networks resources are usually distributed across multiple nodes of the network. Although consequently an issue is that some may out or abandon download,though others may still end up getting data download on rest of the nodes in the network.  

### Client server 

The Client-server is a centeralised distrubution network model that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. The client server functions similairly to a request response messaging pattern.The client sends a request, and the server returns a response (exchange of messages is an example of  inter-process communication).

A benefit of a Client-server network is that the access, resources and integrity of the data are controlled by a dedicated server ensuring that  a program or unauthorised clients cannot damage the system. This centralization also facilitates task of updating data or other resources (better than the networks P2P). 

Whilst the server and clients capacity can be increased seperately, with any element enhanced at any time, or new nodes being added to the network (client or servers).The Client -server also heralds easy maintenance with the distribution of roles and responsibilities spread across several standalone computers. While it is plausable to replace, repair, upgrade, or move a server, during run time with customers minimally affected.This independence of the changes is also known as encapsulation.

Though a problem in the paradigm (model) Client-server is traffic congestion, simultaneous clients sending requests to the same server might cause many problems (to more customers, more problems for the server). On the contrary, P2P networks each node in the network server also makes more nodes, the better bandwidth you have (node - computer). 

Moreover the Client - server network due to the Classic centralisation, does not have the robustness of a network P2P.This is because as there is only one hub, when the hub is down, customer requests cannot be met.


### Cloud 

The Cloud is referred to as a computer network that exists within or is part of a cloud computing infrastructure.A  cloud is a collection of computer systems. 


The cloud is collaborative, allowing the alteraction of a document simintanouseasly 




### Cluster

Cluster differs from Cloud and Grid in that a cluster is a group of computers connected by a local area network (LAN), whereas cloud and grid are more wide scale and can be geographically distributed. The networked computers essentially act as a single, much more powerful machine. A computer cluster provides much faster processing speed, larger storage capacity, better data integrity, superior reliability and wider availability of resources.

However a disadvantage of a cluster network (computer clusters) is that it is not cost efficent, costing more to implement and maintain. This results in much higher running overhead compared to a single computer.

### Centralised

### Virtualised  


purpose, benefits, resource implications, communications, working practice, commercial opportunity, information sharing, collaboration


Purpose, benefits,resources required (servers software, cost, money, a lot or not much required), communications working practices, advantages from a working point of view, collaboration, etc.


benefits and constraints

talk about osi and tcp and the point of the conceptual models (gives us visualisation, can agree it and share the same information having a common understanding / a way of companys and manufacturers agreeing how it should be done creating standards ensuring they can communicate ways to agree how to solve problems ensuring things support the big picture)

2 conceptual models osi and tcp  (tcp model is a less layered version osi)

tcp protocol is not the same as the model

comparision between two 

tcp sits in the osi model 


conceptual models, osi models, tct model (using a table)

osi application layer talking about system /  networking applications (transferring information etc.)

IEEE (802.3, etc.) standards about physical cabling and transmission of data

mesh topology 

protocols ipv4 (ipv6) ipv4 run out of ip addressess have tech to minimize the number of addressess used /  classic internet protocol
your address on the internet (private addressess not viable in the internet / public avaliable on the internet)


dns (domain name system) -  converts domain names to ip addressess and vice versa (ip addressess to domain names) ask parent dns if dont know (6-7 route dns systems in the world) information constantly updated


To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a communications protocol. All client-server protocols operate in the application layer. The application layer protocol defines the basic patterns of the dialogue. To formalize the data exchange even further, the server may implement an application programming interface (API).[3] The API is an abstraction layer for accessing a service. By restricting communication to a specific content format, it facilitates parsing. By abstracting access, it facilitates cross-platform data exchange.
